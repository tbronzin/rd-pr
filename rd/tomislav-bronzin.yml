I am a speaker at a number of IT and business conferences, a Ph.D. candidate and lecturer at University College, an author of IT-related scientific papers, and a mentor to a number of students, MS Community members, and MVP candidates ðŸ˜Š. I have delivered a number of workshops from Silicon Valley, Europe, and Asia about different technologies, both from an architectural and deep technical point of view. As a trusted advisor for Croatian institutions and Croatian delegate to EU institutions, I am participating in efforts to create national and EU strategies in the fields of AI, IoT, Cyber Security, and Cloud Computing. As a Business Development Consultant, in the past 15 years, I have helped prepare funding and launch for 10+ Microsoft Innovation Centers in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Moldova, Georgia, and Armenia and helped to create several National ICT Strategies. I have been one of the founders of Microsoft Community in Croatia, a Microsoft Regional Director, and I have helped found a number of Microsoft Communities in Central & Eastern Europe. I have been Microsoft Most Valuable Professional 19 years in a row, based on my recognized expertise and community work, including mentoring other speakers, Community Champs, today active MVPs, and some of the Regional Directors that are part of the current RD program.
